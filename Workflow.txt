Inputs:
    A Fasta formatted file of sequences which are assumed to have a target
in their center
Optional inputs:
    Pivot Length
    Free Energy Range or Primer Length
    Annealing generations
    Total generations

Outputs
    A fasta formated set of primer sequences

Processing

Identify Candidate probes
    //Hash table might be better here
    Build a set of 4 suffix arrays for Upstream, Downstream, RevUp, and RevDown
        from all sequences which meat the FreeEnergy/Probe length requirements 
        in the relevant areas
    Attempt to Establish interchangeability protocols
        i.e Forward 1 has the same coverage as forward 5 and 7 
    Select one, maximal Coverage Set (S_0)
        Note: Attempts should be made to avoid redundancy in target coverage
Simulated Annealing
    g = 0
    Calculate the Loss function of S_g
    Randomly select a primer to swap for an equivalent primer (or set of primers?)
    Calculate the Loss function with the swap and compare to that of S_g
    Accept the Swapped primer set as S_g+1 if It is better, or with a probability inversly proportional to how much worse it is
    Repeat until enough generations have been completed

Ouptut the final primer set

The ratio of forward to reverse primers should be noted
i.e if one forward primer covers 6 targets, 4 with one reverse primer and 2
with another then there should be 3 times more of the forward than the latter reverse, and
2 times as much of the former reverse as the latter.
Might be able to just say the number of targets each primer amps for
