V2.0.0
Added Min and max primer length options, removed specific primer length option. The removed option can
still be acheived by setting me and max to be equal (this is what occured internally anyway).
Loss of backwards compatability  
V1.5.1
Changed Excitability to wind down to swapping only one primer by the end of simulated
annealing rather than gradient descent
V1.5.0
Added a check during badness calculations that significantly reduces the badness if a non-T
mismatch is present at the 3` end of a primer
V1.4.0
Added option to output all candidate primers to stdout in fasta format so external prefiltering can be
done
V1.3.0
Changes to chain heat and annealing schedule
Automatic heating period where the chain temperature is adjusted until an optimal acceptance rate is
found
The primer set is adjusted during the heating period
The annealing schdule then cools logarithmicly with generation umber
Chain Heat option is no longer available
V1.2.1
Fixed bug where Target names were truncated resulting in redundancy
V1.2.0
Added a column to the primer info output, the 'score' for a primer, the sum of badness
    against all other primers just for this one primer, useful for predicting which primers
    should be bad
V1.1.0
Updated default excitability to be 0.01 rather than 0.1 (0.1 is too bouncy)
When loading id's of targets only takes the string up to the first space in the fasta
    header, assuming this bit is unique. Cuts a tiny bit down on memory, but mostly just
    improves legibility of target_info file
V1.0.0
